# Changelog #

## Version 2.35.13 (August 7, 2024) ##
* FIX: Fix the 'Files and Folders Ignore Strings - Do Not Process' functionality.

## Version 2.35.12 (August 3, 2024) ##
* FIX: Fix an undefined array key due to the new template redirect priority option.

## Version 2.35.11 (August 2, 2024) ##
* FIX: Allow users to set the template_redirect priority which allows other plugins or other "things" to handle 404s before this plugin handles it. Hopefully this will fix an issue where some payment systems purposefully direct to non-existent pages and then handle them.
* Improvement: Try to fix some sql "contains invalid data" issues when logging redirects.

## Version 2.35.10 (July 11, 2024) ##
* FIX: Avoid an Undefined array key warning in PHP 8. Thanks @peterbp.

## Version 2.35.9 (April 17, 2024) ##
* FIX: Fix an undefined constant warning for PHP 7 (and probably 8).
* FIX: Don't esc_url() before redirecting, because it escapes things like & when it shouldn't (thanks @wordknowledge).
* Update: Apparently made the levenshtein distance algorithm slightly more efficient, but I made the change a while ago and honestly don't remember it. But I think probably it won't break anything so I guess it's okay.

## Version 2.35.8 (January 31, 2024) ##
* Update: Fixed a supposed issue on the logs page that 1. I was unable to reproduce and 2. would definitely only be possible if you were an admin user anyway, so I'm not really sure why it was reported.

## Version 2.35.7 (November 10, 2023) ##
* FIX: Avoid an Undefined array key for SERVER_NAME for some people.

## Version 2.35.6 (November 9, 2023) ##

## Version 2.35.4 (November 4, 2023) ##
* FIX: Correctly log redirects to the default 404 page. 
* FIX: Allow redirecting to the homepage again (broken in 2.35.3).

## Version 2.35.3 (November 3, 2023) ##
* FIX: Avoid a PHP warning preg_replace(): Passing null to parameter #3. It looks like this was preventing someone from saving their settings.
* FIX: Better handle the case When a redirect is created and then the destination page is deleted. Redirects with deleted destinations always appear at the top of the list of redirects.

## Version 2.35.2 (November 2, 2023) ##
* Improvement: Add more log messages to help diagnose issues.

## Version 2.35.1 (November 1, 2023) ##

* Improvement: Redirects to pages that have been deleted now appear red in UI so they're easy to see.
* FIX: Fixed a supposed SQL injection issue that I was unable to reproduce and would definitely only be possible if you were an admin user anyway, so I'm not really sure why it was reported, but thanks anyway I guess.

## Version 2.33.1 (October 13, 2023) ##
